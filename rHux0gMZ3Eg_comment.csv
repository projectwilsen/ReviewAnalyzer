For the part at 18:49: I didn't have to type in the python interpreter, VS Code already proposed me the one in the virtual enviornment folder created by pipenv. But unlike you, when I create a new terminal, it does not automatically start the ""activate"" script. I can use the command ""pipenv shell"" and I get into the virtual enviornment (my terminal is called pipenv from then on). But at that point i can additionally, manually start the ""activate"" script and my prompt gains ""(folder_name)"" infront. Do i have to use the activate script? I thought I would be already inside the virtual enviornment if i use ""pipenv shell"".

In other languages there is some sense of essential unity, what we might call an ""idiom""; I could find no such coherence in Django.  The keywords seem drawn from many dissimilar languages.
